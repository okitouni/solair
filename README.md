## How to use
The high-level scripts you should be using are `run.py` and `optimization.py`.

Here's a breakdown of what everything does (roughly).
`run.py`: Run a single simulation based on the CLI arguments in the file.
`optimization.py`: Essentially runs `run.py` multiple times inside a TurBO optimization loop. Output is written into the directory `outputs`.
`constants.py`: 
`design.py`: 
`simulator.py`: 
(Some of the simulation configuration is in `constants.py`)
